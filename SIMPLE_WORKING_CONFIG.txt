SIMPLE WORKING NGINX CONFIGURATION
==================================

CLEAR the nginx directives box completely.

ADD ONLY this single location block:

location /app/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}

THEN ACCESS:
https://opt.vivaindia.com/app/

This single configuration will:
- Avoid all duplicate location conflicts
- Proxy correctly to your running server
- Give you full access to OptiStore Pro medical management system

No complex configurations needed - just this one simple block.
