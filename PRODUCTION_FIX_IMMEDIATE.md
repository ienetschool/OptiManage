# PRODUCTION UPDATE ENDPOINTS - IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
Production server is missing ALL UPDATE endpoints:
- PUT /api/patients/:id
- PUT /api/medical-appointments/:id  
- PUT /api/prescriptions/:id
- PUT /api/doctors/:id

## CURRENT STATUS
- ✅ Development: UPDATE endpoints working perfectly
- ❌ Production: UPDATE endpoints return 404 or method not allowed
- ✅ Production server: Running and responsive (dashboard API working)
- ✅ Database: MySQL connection working on production

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Method 1: Direct File Upload
```bash
# 1. Upload fixed file to production
scp server/medicalRoutes.ts root@5.181.218.15:/var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/opt.vivaindia.sql/server/

# 2. SSH into production and restart
ssh root@5.181.218.15
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/opt.vivaindia.sql
pkill -f tsx
DATABASE_URL="mysql://ledbpt_optie:g79h94LAP@5.181.218.15:3306/opticpro" PORT=8080 tsx server/index.ts > production.log 2>&1 &
```

### Method 2: Manual Code Replacement
SSH into production and replace the entire medicalRoutes.ts file with the content from PRODUCTION_MANUAL_DEPLOY.txt

## TEST AFTER DEPLOYMENT
```bash
# Test UPDATE endpoint
curl -X PUT https://opt.vivaindia.com/api/patients/PATIENT_ID -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"firstName":"UpdatedName"}'
```

Expected: 200 status with updated patient data
Current: 404 or method not allowed

## ROOT CAUSE
The production server is running the old medicalRoutes.ts without the UPDATE endpoints we added in development. Production deployment is required immediately to fix edit/update functionality.
