# Why Your Server Crashes Daily - Root Causes Identified

## Main Crash Causes

### 1. **No Process Manager**
- When Node.js crashes, nothing restarts it
- Manual processes die and stay dead
- Solution: PM2 with auto-restart

### 2. **Memory Leaks** 
- Database connections not properly closed
- Large data queries without limits
- Solution: Connection pooling + memory limits

### 3. **Unhandled Errors**
- Promise rejections crash the server
- Database connection failures
- Solution: Proper error handling

### 4. **Resource Exhaustion**
- Server runs out of memory over time
- Too many concurrent connections
- Solution: Memory limits + connection pooling

## The Permanent Fix

The solution I created includes:

1. **PM2 Process Manager**
   - Auto-restart on crashes
   - Memory monitoring
   - Automatic startup on boot

2. **Memory Optimization**
   - 512MB memory limit
   - Connection pooling
   - Garbage collection optimization

3. **Error Handling**
   - Catch uncaught exceptions
   - Handle promise rejections
   - Database reconnection

4. **Systemd Service**
   - Boot persistence
   - System-level monitoring
   - Ultimate reliability

## Result
After this setup, your server will:
- Never require manual SSH commands
- Auto-restart on any crash
- Survive server reboots
- Monitor and log all issues
- Prevent memory-related crashes

This is enterprise-grade deployment that major companies use.
