TESTING IF FILE CHANGES ARE WORKING - Created at $(date)

If you can see this file, then file changes are working and the issue is elsewhere.

The Sidebar.tsx should have:
- Patient Registration
- Prescriptions  
- Specs Workflow
- Specs Order Creation
- Lens Cutting & Fitting

All 5 items are hardcoded in lines 117-150 of client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx
