- **Validation**: Zod schema validation for all API inputs

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User accesses the application
2. Replit OIDC redirects to authentication provider
3. Successful authentication creates/updates user session
4. Session stored in PostgreSQL with automatic expiration
5. Frontend receives user data and renders authenticated interface

### Business Operations Flow
1. Frontend components make API requests using TanStack Query
2. Express middleware handles request validation and authentication
3. Database operations performed through Drizzle ORM
4. Results returned as JSON with appropriate HTTP status codes
5. Frontend automatically updates UI based on server responses

### Real-time Updates
- Client-side query invalidation for immediate UI updates
- Optimistic updates for improved user experience
- Background refetching for data consistency
