ADDITIONAL CHECKS FOR PLESK PROXY CONFIGURATION:

The 502 error might be due to nginx proxy configuration in Plesk.

Run these commands on your server to check:

1. Check nginx proxy configuration:
   grep -r "opt.vivaindia.com" /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/conf/

2. Check if nginx is properly configured to proxy to port 8080:
   cat /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/conf/vhost.conf

3. If proxy is not configured, you may need to access directly:
   Try: http://opt.vivaindia.com:8080

4. Or configure Plesk proxy:
   - Go to Plesk Panel
   - Select vivaindia.com domain
   - Go to "Apache & nginx Settings"
   - Add proxy rules to forward requests to localhost:8080

The server is likely running on port 8080 but nginx isn't forwarding requests to it.
