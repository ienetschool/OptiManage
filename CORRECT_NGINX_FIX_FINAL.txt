CORRECT NGINX CONFIGURATION - NO DUPLICATES
==========================================

The error shows "duplicate location '/'" which means Plesk already has a location / block.

SOLUTION: Use a unique location that won't conflict.

STEP 1: DELETE ALL content from nginx directives box

STEP 2: Add ONLY this configuration:

location /medapp/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}

STEP 3: Access your app at:
https://opt.vivaindia.com/medapp/

This configuration:
- Uses /medapp/ instead of / (no conflict)
- Proxies to your Node.js server on port 8080
- Will work without duplicate location errors

Your medical practice management system will be fully accessible at the new URL.
