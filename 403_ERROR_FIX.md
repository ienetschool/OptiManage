# 403 FORBIDDEN ERROR FIX

## EXCELLENT PROGRESS!
✅ Server is now running and responding (no more 502 errors)
✅ PM2 process is working correctly
❌ Getting 403 Forbidden - permissions/access issue

## Root Cause Analysis
403 Forbidden means:
1. Server is running and accessible
2. Nginx proxy is working
3. But there's an access restriction or file permission issue

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Try Different URL Paths
Test these URLs:
- https://opt.vivaindia.com/app/api/dashboard
- https://opt.vivaindia.com/api/dashboard  
- https://opt.vivaindia.com:8080/

### Option 2: Check Plesk File Permissions
In SSH:
```bash
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/opt.vivaindia.sql
ls -la
chown -R vivassh:psacln .
chmod -R 755 .
```

### Option 3: Update Nginx Configuration
In Plesk, try this simpler configuration:
```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

### Option 4: Test Direct Server Access
In SSH:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
curl http://localhost:8080/api/dashboard
```

## Why This is Good News
- Server is alive and responding
- Database connection working
- PM2 auto-restart is functional
- Just need to fix the access path

The medical practice management system is very close to being fully operational!
