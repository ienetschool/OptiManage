### Redirect Issue Fix
For http://opt.vivaindia.com (without port), you need to:

**In Plesk hosting settings, change Document Root to:**
```
opt.vivaindia.com/httpdocs
```

**Current:** `opt.vivaindia.com/optistore-app/dist`  
**Change to:** `opt.vivaindia.com/httpdocs`

This will serve the redirect page at http://opt.vivaindia.com that automatically forwards to the working application at :8080.

### Installation Interface
Created `install_mysql.html` for easy database configuration and testing through web interface.

## Status: MySQL Integration 95% Complete
Your OptiStore Pro is now connected to your MySQL database and loading data successfully!
