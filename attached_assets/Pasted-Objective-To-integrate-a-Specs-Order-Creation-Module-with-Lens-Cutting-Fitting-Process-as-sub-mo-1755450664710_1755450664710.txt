Objective:

To integrate a Specs Order Creation Module with Lens Cutting & Fitting Process as sub-modules. The goal is to create a clear and efficient workflow that includes prescription creation, inventory checks, task assignments, fitting stages, and delivery.

Module 1: Specs Order Creation (Standalone)

This module is responsible for creating the specs order based on the prescription details. It should operate like a sales invoice, with inventory checks, pricing, and patient history linkage.

Features of Specs Order Creation:

Auto-Fill Prescription Details:

Populate lens type, material, frame, and prescription data.

Inventory Check:

Real-time stock check for the prescribed lenses, frames, and accessories.

Pricing:

Auto-pull pricing from the inventory database.

Patient History Link:

Link the order to the patient's history and medical records.

Invoice Generation:

Generate a sales invoice for the patient, including taxes and payment details.

Action Buttons:

Check Inventory Availability: Verify stock availability for all items.

Add to Order: Add selected lenses, frames, and accessories to the order.

Generate Invoice: Create an invoice for the patient based on selected items.

Save as Draft: Save the order for future edits.

Confirm Order: Finalize the order and generate patient history record.

System Features:

Auto-Check Inventory: Real-time validation to ensure stock availability.

Invoice System Integration: Automatically generate and save invoices linked to patient records.

Sub-Modules of Specs Order Creation:

These sub-modules handle specific tasks related to the Lens Cutting & Fitting Process after an order has been created. Each stage involves progress tracking, notifications, and task assignments.

Sub-Module 1: Assign Lens Cutting Task

After the specs order has been created, the Lens Cutting Task needs to be assigned to a fitter or lab technician.

Features:

Task Details: Include lens type, material, frame, and any special instructions (e.g., coatings).

Deadline Setting: Set a deadline for task completion.

Action Buttons:

Upload Task Details: Upload additional specs or instructions if necessary.

Notifications:

To Fitter: "You have a new lens cutting task assigned for Patient [Name]. Please check your dashboard for details."

Sub-Module 2: Fitting in Progress

Once the fitter begins working on the lenses, the status should be marked as In Progress. The fitter will also have the option to add remarks, upload photos, and update the task progress.

Features:

Status Update: Mark the task as "In Progress" once it starts.

Remarks: Add notes on task progress, any issues, or additional instructions.

Photo Upload: Option to upload images showing the work progress.

Sub-Module 3: Send to Store

Once the lens cutting and fitting are complete, the next step is to send the specs to the store for delivery preparation.

Features:

Task Completion: Marks the task as complete and sends the specs to the store.

Delivery Tracking: Optionally add tracking information.

Delivery Notes: Attach any specific delivery instructions for the store.

Action Buttons:

Update Tracking Info: Add or update delivery tracking details.

Notifications:

To Store: "Lens cutting task for Patient [Name] is complete. Please prepare for delivery."

To Admin: "Lens cutting and fitting for Patient [Name] completed and sent to the store."

Sub-Module 4: Delivery Ready & Final Checks

This step marks the final checks before delivery. The store will confirm that the specs are ready to be delivered or picked up.

Features:

Final Confirmation: Confirm that the specs are ready for delivery.

Delivery Method: Choose between pickup or courier.

Final Remarks: Add final remarks about the order and its readiness.

Action Buttons:

Mark as Ready for Delivery: Confirm that the specs are ready for delivery.

Schedule Delivery: Set a delivery date and time for courier or patient pickup.

üìß Email Notification Templates

To Fitter:

Subject: New Lens Cutting Task Assigned

Body: "You have been assigned a new lens fitting task for Patient [Name]. Please check your dashboard for details."

To Store:

Subject: Lens Cutting Task Completed

Body: "The lens cutting task for Patient [Name] has been completed. Please prepare accordingly for delivery."

To Patient:

Subject: Your Specs Are Ready for Delivery

Body: "Dear [Patient Name], your spectacles are now ready for delivery. Please collect them or expect delivery on [Date]."

Integration Steps in Code:

Database Integration:

Create a Specs Orders Table that links to prescription data, inventory, and patient history.

Add fields for inventory tracking and delivery status.

Task Assignment System:

Implement an assignment system for assigning tasks (lens cutting, fitting) to fitters and technicians.

Create a notification system to alert fitters and store staff about new tasks, progress updates, and delivery confirmations.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Implement RBAC to limit access to various modules based on the user role. E.g., only Admins can view invoices, while fitters can view assigned tasks.

With this structure, the Specs Order Creation Module is a separate module, and the Lens Cutting & Fitting Process becomes a series of sub-modules, each with its own distinct actions and responsibilities. This makes it easier to track progress, assign tasks, and ensure smooth operation at every stage of the process.
