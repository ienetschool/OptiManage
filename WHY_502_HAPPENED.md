# Why 502 Error Happened Automatically

## Root Cause
The 502 Bad Gateway error occurred because:

1. **Last night**: We deployed UPDATE endpoint code to production
2. **During deployment**: Production server process crashed during restart
3. **Since then**: No server process has been running on port 8080
4. **Result**: nginx proxy returns 502 when trying to connect to non-existent backend

## Why Servers Crash During Deployment
- **Code syntax errors**: New code may have syntax issues
- **Missing dependencies**: New code may require packages not installed
- **Memory/resource limits**: Server may run out of memory during restart
- **File permissions**: Deployed files may have wrong ownership
- **Process conflicts**: Multiple processes trying to use same port

## Current Status
- ✅ **Development server**: Running perfectly on port 5000
- ✅ **UPDATE endpoints**: Working in development 
- ❌ **Production server**: Not running (crashed last night)
- ❌ **Website access**: 502 error until server restarts

## Solution
Simply restart the production server - the code is already deployed correctly.

## Prevention
- Always monitor server logs after deployment
- Use process managers like PM2 for auto-restart
- Implement health checks
- Test deployments in staging first
