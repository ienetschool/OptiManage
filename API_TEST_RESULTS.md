# API Test Results

## Current Status
- ❌ Main website: 502 Bad Gateway
- ❌ API endpoints: 502 Bad Gateway  
- ❌ Patient API: 502 Bad Gateway

## Previous Test Results (from auto-deploy.sh)
- ✅ Dashboard API working
- ✅ Patient registration working

## Issue Analysis
There's a contradiction here. The auto-deploy script reported APIs working, but direct curl tests show 502 errors. This suggests:

1. **Server Process Issue**: The server might have crashed after the deployment test
2. **Nginx Configuration**: Proxy settings might not be routing correctly
3. **Static File Serving**: Frontend build might not be properly served

## Immediate Solutions Needed
1. Restart the Node.js server on port 8080
2. Ensure frontend is built and copied to server/public/
3. Verify nginx is properly proxying to localhost:8080

## Production Server Requirements
- Node.js server must be running on port 8080
- Frontend must be built with `npm run build`
- Static files must be in server/public/
- MySQL connection must be active: mysql://ledbpt_optie:g79h94LAP@localhost:3306/opticpro
