CRITICAL: Run these commands in your SSH terminal to see what's wrong:

1. Check if server started and what error occurred:
   tail -30 production.log

2. Check if tsx is installed and working:
   which tsx
   tsx --version

3. Check if there are syntax errors in the deployed code:
   cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/opt.vivaindia.sql
   tsx --check server/index.ts

4. Try starting server in foreground to see exact error:
   DATABASE_URL="mysql://ledbpt_optie:g79h94LAP@5.181.218.15:3306/opticpro" PORT=8080 tsx server/index.ts

5. If tsx is missing, install it:
   npm install -g tsx

6. If permission issues, fix ownership:
   chown -R vivassh:psacln /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/opt.vivaindia.sql

Run command #1 first and tell me what error you see in the log!
