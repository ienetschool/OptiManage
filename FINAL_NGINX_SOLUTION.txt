FINAL NGINX SOLUTION - AFTER SERVER RESTART
==========================================

Once your production server is confirmed running (via SSH commands), use this nginx configuration:

STEP 1: Clear all nginx directives in Plesk

STEP 2: Add this minimal working configuration:

location /medical/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_read_timeout 300;
    proxy_connect_timeout 300;
}

STEP 3: Access your medical practice app at:
https://opt.vivaindia.com/medical/

ALTERNATIVE - If nginx keeps causing issues:

Use direct port access (bypassing nginx entirely):
https://opt.vivaindia.com:8080

This gives you immediate access to OptiStore Pro while avoiding all nginx conflicts.

Both approaches will provide full access to:
- Patient management
- Appointment scheduling  
- Prescription management
- Invoice generation
- All CRUD operations
